      <h2>Chapter 1: The Lie I Had to Tell</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up with both my parents, but it was never really a happy story. At some point, my dad left and married another wife. I was left with my mom — a woman I constantly fought with. She was always working, always chasing something, and though I understand why now, back then I just needed her attention. We never had a strong bond.
      </p>

      <p>
        In primary school, I had no friends I could open up to. I created this perfect version of my life and wore it like a mask. It was easier than admitting I felt unwanted. That’s when the small shadow of depression crept in.
      </p>

      <p>
        My dad was alive, somewhere. But I didn’t see him again. I had to speak well of him to people who already knew him just to avoid questions and to protect his image — even if it killed me inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        My mom was pushing hard at work, trying to make a living and a name for herself. I admire her strength, but I was just a child who needed someone. I learned to be independent because I spent most of my time alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the beginning. The start of a long path of figuring things out on my own. A path where writing became my outlet — the only way to tell my truth.
      </p>

      <h2>Chapter 2: My Escape</h2>
      <p>
        Every day, the silence and emotional absence at home chipped away at me. It became normal to cry myself to sleep or hide my sadness behind jokes and distractions. I didn’t know it then, but my mom and I were both suffering from the same thing — the absence of love, care, and healing.
      </p>

      <p>
        My only true escape was going to my grandmother’s house. That place felt like home. My cousins and I would sit together every night — gossiping, laughing, and sometimes even fighting. But that’s what made it feel like family. It was the kind of connection I craved daily.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also had one close friend. Her father worked with my mom, and he became a kind of father figure in my life. He would take us fishing, out to kids’ restaurants, and show me small glimpses of the warmth I missed. Those were rare moments of peace — moments I held onto tightly.
      </p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 3: The Girl Who Learned to Hide</h2>
<p>
  As I got older, I became good at hiding. Hiding pain. Hiding truth. Hiding the version of myself that longed to scream but only whispered. I smiled more in public, laughed louder, and acted like life was normal — like I had it all figured out. But inside, I was a girl unraveling quietly.
</p>

<p>
  I had mastered survival, not healing.
</p>

<p>
  I started excelling in school — not because I was always focused, but because achieving something was the only way to feel seen. Every good grade, every compliment from a teacher felt like a breath of air after being underwater too long. I wasn’t just trying to succeed; I was begging to be noticed.
</p>

<p>
  At school, I became part of a clique of girls. On the outside, we looked inseparable — always laughing, taking pictures, sharing secrets. But that group was its own battlefield. Every day felt like a silent competition. There were always girl fights, gossip, comparing ourselves to others, glorifying some and shaming others. I lived in the shadow of the "prettiest" ones — shrinking myself just to stay accepted. I wanted so badly to fit in, even when it cost me pieces of myself.
</p>

<p>
  At home, things stayed the same. My mom and I were distant — like strangers with the same surname. We'd argue over small things, but the fights were never about the dishes or my tone. They were about unspoken hurt, the years of silence, the love we didn’t know how to give each other. I now understand she was just doing her best with what life handed her — just like I was.
</p>

<p>
  But back then, all I saw was a wall between us that kept growing.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes I’d cry in the bathtub. Sometimes I’d write letters I never sent. I still visited my grandmother’s house, still found pieces of peace there, but they weren’t enough to fix the cracks in my chest. I felt like I didn’t belong anywhere — not at home, not with friends, not even in my own body.
</p>

<p>
  That’s when I began writing seriously.
</p>

<p>
  Not just for expression, but for survival.
</p>

<p>
  Writing was the only place I was fully me — raw, honest, ugly, beautiful. It became the mirror I could finally look into without pretending.
</p>

<p>
  This chapter of my life was not loud. It was quiet. But it was the beginning of something sacred — the slow, painful journey toward healing.
