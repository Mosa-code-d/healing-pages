 <!-- Blog Introduction -->
    <section class="intro">
      <p>
        Healing Pages was created by a varsity student who has walked through emotional storms,
        cried silently in lecture halls, and fought battles no one saw. Writing became her way to
        survive â€” and now, to thrive. This platform was born from that same resilience, opening a
        space for others to offload, heal, and find comfort in shared experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we write our truths. Yours and mine. Because healing begins with being heard.
